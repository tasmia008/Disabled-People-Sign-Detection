# Disabled People Sign Detection

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a sign detection model specifically designed to detect signs related to disabled people. The model is based on the YOLOv8 architecture and is trained using TensorFlow.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images of disabled people signs along with corresponding label files in the YOLO format. The dataset is divided into three parts: training, validation, and testing. The training and validation subsets are used for model training and hyperparameter tuning, while the testing subset is used for evaluating the trained model's performance.

The dataset can be obtained from the following locations:

- Training images: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/train/images`
- Training labels: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/train/labels`
- Validation images: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/valid/images`
- Validation labels: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/valid/labels`
- Testing images: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/test/images`
- Testing labels: `/kaggle/input/disabled-people-sign-detection/disabled_sign_detection/test/labels`

## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/disabled-people-sign-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directories as mentioned in the Dataset section.
4. Run the code: `python main.py`




## Results

After running the code, the model will be trained and evaluated using the provided dataset. The training progress and evaluation results will be displayed in the console, and plots showing the loss and performance metrics will be saved.

Additionally, the model's predictions on the testing subset will be visualized using bounding boxes. The ground truth bounding boxes are shown in red, while the model's predictions are shown in yellow.
